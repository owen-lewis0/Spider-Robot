# Spider-Robot
Only worked on Spider.cpp, SpiderLeg.cpp, and Main.cpp, other files added for context.
Functions were added that allowed the spider to move forwards and backwards, turn left and right,
and stand up smoothly upon boot-up.

All files were uploaded to the robot via a Linux simulation environment.
